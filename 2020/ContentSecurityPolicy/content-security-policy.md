## What is Cross Site Scripting (XSS)?

- XSS enables an attacker to inject client-side script into non-malicious web pages viewed by other users.
- It’s (still) in the OWASP top 10.
- In 2016 there was a 61% likeihood of a brower-based vulnerability being found in a web application.
- Of those brower based vulnerablities, 86% were found to be XSS related.
- That’s just over 52% of all web application vulnerablities.
